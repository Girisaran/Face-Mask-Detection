# Face-Mask-Detection
## our project is Face mask detection
## Description
Coronavirus[i] started spreading in 2019. Many people have contracted this virus and some have died. People are taking various preventive measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The important precaution is wearing a face mask in public places. However, some people are not wearing masks as the spread of coronavirus is increasing day by day. In some places in hospitals where people always wear masks, and there are people who don't. To avoid these problems, it is necessary to look for people who are not wearing masks in public places, but there is a problem that those who check may be infected with coronavirus. In order to solve this problem, we need to implement an automatic facemask detector[ii] by using deep learning[iii]namely deep neural network[iv](DNN) to check more accurate whether the people are wearing and not wearing the mask.https://github.com/Girisaran/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/main

## USE CASES
Image Capture: The first step in the real-time mask detection system is image capture. Use a camera or scanner to capture high- quality images of people with or without face masks.

Load dataset: A well-defined dataset should be created by appropriately tagging the captured images with a unique class.

Training model: The DNN is trained using a data set consisting of images of people with and without face masks. 
D. Evaluate Model: The obtained images are subjected to preprocessing steps by evolutionary means during evaluation after improvement, especially for image features. The segmentation process is used to split the image into multiple layers and detect the areas covered by the face mask on the subject's face from the background. This situation affects the deep neural network layers that get the image features from theresized image and connect after each convolution. The size is reduced by max pooling and average pooling in feature extraction. Ultimately, both deep neural layers and pooling layers act as scavengers to create these image features. 

E. Applying the classifier: After training her DNN for mask recognition with the help of the dataset, the DNN uses the learned visual patterns to determine which people are wearing face masks. You can classify whether or not I implemented Tensorflow mainly in Python. In Tensorflow I used Keras for classification.
